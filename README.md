# Rail Nightly Pickems

The rails deployment of my *Nightly Pickems* app.

## Nightly Pickems

The premise is simple. A user can create an account and log into the web app. NHL games for each night of the hockey season are listed. The user can pick who they think will win each of these NHL games. Picks are locked in place at game time.

This system allows users to create competitions between friends and see who can most accuratly predict the winner of NHL games.
